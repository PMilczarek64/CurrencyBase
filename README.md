  <p>
    CurrencyBase is a simple web application written in React to convert currency values. The main purpose of writing this app was to practice creating unit tests using the React Testing Library and Jest.

Unit tests validate the correctness of individual components, such as the correctness of component rendering and data entry handling. In addition, integration tests were implemented in the application to validate the application as a whole.
